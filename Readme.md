SPOTYXBMC2
==========
This is a rewrite of the s potyxbmc project, the code is cleaner and better encapsulated from XBMC. It is now being prepared to be lifted out to a binary addon.
The code is not heavily tested and has known issues, don´t install if you don´t know what you are doing.

The main discussion for spotyxbmc is [here](http://forum.xbmc.org/showthread.php?t=67012)
A discussion concerning a unified music addon front-end can be read [here](http://forum.xbmc.org/showthread.php?t=105147).

You must have a valid spotify premium account to be able to use spotyXBMC.

Features and usage
------------------
This implementation adds spotify content to the regular music categories under the music section, do not try to run the addon, its only there for settings!

A video showing most of the features can be seen [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFSdxKyWXpU).

* Starred tracks, albums and artists will show up in the songs, albums and artists sections alongside the local music.
* Spotify playlists shows up in the playlist section.
* The normal music search will return local music and spotify search result.
* Top 100 spotify lists with artists, albums and tracks is available in the top 100 section.
* Modifying playlists and star/unstar items in the spotify client will result in that the lists is updated in XBMC.
* Multi-disc albums are split up into separate albums with suffix "disc #".
* Browsing artist albums will provide a "similar artists" folder with spotify similar artists.
* Navigate to the album artist from an album or to the artist or album from a track using the context menu.
* Star/unstar albums and tracks from within XBMC using the context menu.
* The settings is changed from within a built-in addon.
* Two spotify "radios" is provided int the music root, visit the settings to set name, years and genres.
* Top-lists will update once every 24 hour.

Missing features
----------------
* Interaction with spotify items like creating and modify playlists, adding spotify tracks to playlists and so on is not supported yet.
* The year and genre nodes will not lead to any spotify items yet.
* A lot more I guess.

Platforms
---------

* Linux - supported
* Windows - supported
* OSX - Not supported

Known issues
------------
Enable preloading of artists together with preloading of top 100 lists and/or a massive collection of starred tracks will result in a short freeze of XBMC during start (about 5-10 seconds depending on your Internet speed, computer...).

Memory leaks do exist, beware.

A lot of other bugs, the implementation is not heavily tested.
 
Want to help killing a bug?
---------------------------
Right now the there is a lot of trace prints, they are printed out straight to the console so be sure that you start XBMC from a console in order to fetch the traces and create a bug report.

Please submit a report to the github issues and provide all relevant data like logs, OS info, what track, playlist or album you have problems with. Or even better, fix it yourself and send me a pull request or an e-mail.
